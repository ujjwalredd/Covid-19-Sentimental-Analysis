# COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis using BERT, RoBERTa, Sequential, and Topic Modeling.
This project uses a variety of machine learning models, such as BERT, RoBERTa, Sequential models, and Topic Modelling, to perform sentiment analysis on text data connected to COVID-19. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of various models and identify which one provides the highest level of sentiment categorization accuracy.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
* `data.py`: In this file we need to change the path of dataset file. 
* `bert.py`: In this file we have the bert model.
* `robert.py`: In this file we have the roberta model.
* `sequential.py`: In this file we have the sequential model with ELU layer added.
* `topic.py`: In this file we have the topic model code.
* `model.py`: In this file we have the return values all the models.
* `main.py`: In this file we have the main code.
* `accuracy.py`: In this file we have accuracy comparison.

Change all the neccesary column cahnges to be done in all the files.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Transformers library (for BERT and RoBERTa models)
* TensorFlow (for Sequential models)
* Scikit-learn (for topic modeling)
